The FORTRAN relativistic finite-temperature Hartree-Bogoliubov (FT-RHB) solver in harmonic oscillator basis with an explicit treatment of the particle continuum. The code assumes axial symmetry, conserved parity, and time-reversal symmetry. It is suitable for the description of hot even-even nuclei, including pairing and deformation effects. The code is based on zero-temperature RHB code DIRHBZ described in Ref. [^3]. The extension to finite temperature RHB is derived in Ref. [^4], while the Bonche-Levit-Vautherin subtraction procedure is detailed in Ref. [^5]. The DIRHBZ_BLV code implements the latter two frameworks.

The code uses the Intel compilers, MPI for parallel calculations, and MKL library for matrix operations. We recommend downloading the oneAPI tools from:

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html

Make sure that ```mpiifort``` is installed. To compile the calculations use the provided Makefile by typing ```make```.

There are three main files containing the code:
* ```dirhbz.f```- the main file containing the FT-RHB solver routines
* ```dirhbz_vapor.f```- the FT-RHB solver for the vapor states
* ```dirhb.dat```- input file

While the modules are in:
* ```params_module.f90``` - parameters
* ```globals_modules.f``` - variables used through the calculation

The structure of the input ```dirhb.dat```file is as follows:
* ```n0f      =   16  16```
Number of harmonic oscillator shells $N_{osc}$ for fermion and boson states
* ```def-bas  =    -0.000```
The quadrupole deformation of the axial harmonic oscillator basis
* ```b0       =    -1.500```
The harmonic oscillator length parameter, if negative, it is calculated from the prescription $\hbar \omega = 41 A^{-1/3}$ where $A$ is the nucleon number and $\omega$ oscillator frequency.
* ```def-ini  =    -0.000```
Initial quadrupole deformation of the Woods-Saxon basis used to initialize nucleus and vapor potentials.
* ```inin     =    1    1```
Initialization of mean-field and pairing potential (1 - yes)
* ```Sm 180 ```
Nucleus under consideration
* ```Init.Gap =    1.000     1.000```
Initial value of the pairing gap $\Delta$.
* ```Force    =  DD-PC1```
The relativistic functional under consideration. Can choose among: DD-PC1, DD-PCX, DD-PCJ30-36, and DD-ME2
* ```icstr    =  1```
Constrained calculation with quadrupole constraint. It is released after the first 20 calculations.
* ```cquad    =  0.005 ```
Strength of the quadrupole constraint.
* ```temp     =  1.01 ```
Temperature in MeV.
* ```matel    =  0```
Calculate pairing matrix element (0), or read from the ```wnn.del```file (1).

-------------------------------------------

The code uses MPI to split the calculation of potential energy surface on different CPUs. By default, the number of $\beta_2$-meshpoints is 16. This can be easily changed in ```globals_modules.f```. To run the code, after successful compilation, use:
```mpirun -np 11 ./run```

-------------------------------------------

The results of the calculations are stored in the ```results.out```file. It has the following column structure, where each column corresponds to 1 out of the number of $\beta_2$-meshpoints (each with its own initial quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$):

* neutron number
* proton number
* temperature $T$ (MeV)
* subtracted binding energy $E$ (MeV)
* subtracted entropy $S$
* isovector quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$
* neutron root-mean-square radius $r_n$
* proton root-mean-square radius $r_p$
* neutron chemical potential $\lambda_n$ (MeV)
* proton chemical potential $\lambda_p$ (MeV)
* neutron pairing gap $\Delta_n$ (MeV)
* proton pairing gap $\Delta_p$ (MeV)
* number of iterations required for convergence
* density of vapor states
* neutron emission lifetime $T_n$

Other details regarding the iteration-by-iteration convergence for each $\beta_2$-meshpoint are stored in ```dirhb_5xx.out``` files, where xx ranges from 01 to $\beta_2$-meshpoints.

The vector densities are plotted in an $(r,z)$ plane for the Nucleus+Vapor system ```dirhb.plo``` and Vapor only system ```dirhb_vapor.plo``` for quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ which minimizes the free energy $F = E - TS$.
The file ```dirhb_9yy.out```, where yy corresponds to the $\beta_2$-meshpoint which minimizes the free energy.

-------------------------------------------

To benchmark the compilation we have included the ```results.out```file which contains an example run with the provided ```dirhb.dat``` file. As an example calculation, we consider ${}^{180}$Sm with 16 oscillator shells, DD-PC1 interaction, and temperature $T = 1.01$ MeV.
